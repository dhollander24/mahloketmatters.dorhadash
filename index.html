            <h3>Session One - January 26</h3>
            <p>In our first session participants will be introduced to the Mahloket Matters framework. We will study Jewish texts that relate to and frame the philosophy. The texts will help us understand the difference between a mahloket le-shem shamayim (A disagreement for the sake of heaven), and a mahloket Lo le-shem shamayim (a disagreement not for the sake of heaven).</p>
            <p>We will explore the four pillars of constructive disagreement and ask how they might be helpful to apply in our community.</p>
            <p>Texts will be presented in both Hebrew and English, although no prior knowledge of Hebrew is required to participate in the course.</p>
            <h3>Session Two - February 2</h3>
            <p>In this session we will learn about Social Emotional Learning (SEL), understanding different approaches to leadership, and how our personal values apply when looking at moral foundation theory.</p>
            <p>We will look at experiences in our past, and how we might explore things in a new or different frame of mind. There will be an opportunity to share personal experiences and challenges and how they apply to these theories.</p>
            <h3>Session Three - February 9</h3>
            <p>In this session, we will apply skills and knowledge from our first two sessions to mahloket. Participants will be presented with different types of conflicts.</p>
            <p>We will also explore mahloket from <a href="https://www.forthesakeofargument.org/" target="_blank">"For the Sake of Argument"</a> by Abi Dauber Sterne & Robbie Gringras.</p>
            <h3>Session Four - February 16</h3>
            <p>Most of us grow up believing that conflict is a negative experience best avoided. However, research has shown that conflict is not only unavoidable but vital to growth. We first experience mismatches as infants, and how we learn to handle those mismatches from our parents, teachers, peers and other models informs how we try to resolve discord. This lecture will explore some of that research based on <em>The Power of Discord</em> by Dr. Ed Tronick and Dr. Claudia M. Gold, how it applies to everyday life and how we can rethink our own relationships to build stronger ones.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>What is Mahloket?</h2>
        <p>Disagreements are often seen as an unfortunate aspect of life. However, in the tradition of the Mishnah and Talmud, mahkloket (debate) is a vital tool for fostering discussion, critical thinking, personal growth, and the strengthening of relationships.</p>
        <p>The Mahloket Matters initiative aims to highlight the Jewish value of constructive debate. Jewish tradition venerates the notion of productive disagreement and recognizes the potential for personal growth and deeper interpersonal connections through engagement with multiple perspectives.</p>
        <p>This program encourages participants to develop a “constructive conflict mindset” through Jewish text study, social psychology, and social-emotional learning. Ultimately, this mindset is not just for specific issues but serves as a lens to view and engage with the world in a more thoughtful and respectful manner.</p>

        <h2>Why Mahloket Matters</h2>
        <h3>Excerpt for Karen’s article in the Dor Hadash newsletter</h3>
        <p>This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to study in Jerusalem at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies, thanks to the support of Congregation Dor Hadash. Currently, I am a member of Cohort 4 of the Senior Educator Learning Fellowship (SELF). Despite the challenges of traveling during a time of conflict, the gratitude we received from the people there made it deeply meaningful.</p>
        <p>Being part of the SELF cohort was both a personal and professional milestone for me. The experience in Israel was profound, and I look forward to continuing the fellowship with monthly workshops on Zoom, culminating in an in-person gathering in May to conclude our program.</p>
        <p>As part of my role in the SELF fellowship, I have begun to implement the Mahloket Matters curriculum within our community. I have presented to our teachers, at the Pittsburgh Yom Limud (a learning day for part-time religious school teachers), and to my colleagues at PAJE (Pittsburgh Area Jewish Educators).</p>
        <p>The Mahloket Matters mindset employs Jewish texts and social psychology to foster meaningful discussion, critical thinking, personal growth, and deeper relationships.</p>

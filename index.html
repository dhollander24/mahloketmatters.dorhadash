      <h3>Session One - January 26</h3>
      <p>
        In our first session, participants will be introduced to the Mahloket
        Matters framework. We will study Jewish texts that relate to and frame
        the philosophy. The texts will help us understand the difference between
        a mahloket le-shem shamayim (A disagreement for the sake of heaven), and
        a mahloket lo le-shem shamayim (a disagreement not for the sake of
        heaven).
        We will explore the four pillars of constructive disagreement and ask
        how they might be helpful to apply in our community. Texts will be presented in both Hebrew and English, although no prior
        knowledge of Hebrew is required to participate in the course.

      <h3>Session Two - February 2</h3>
      <p>
        In this session, we will learn about Social Emotional Learning (SEL),
        understanding different approaches to leadership, and how our personal
        values apply when looking at moral foundation theory.
        We will look at experiences in our past, and how we might explore things
        in a new or different frame of mind. There will be an opportunity to
        share personal experiences and challenges and how they apply to these
        theories.

        types of conflicts.

      <h3>Session Four - February 16</h3>
      <!-- Subheading immediately under Session Four heading -->
      <h4>featuring Dr. Steven Klein, see bio below</h4>
      <p>
        In our final session, we explore some other approaches to how we
        perceive and manage conflict. Professor Klein will be our guest speaker
        on zoom, from Modi’in, Israel. We will have the opportunity to reflect
        on how this may connect to our study of the Mahloket framework and
        Jewish texts.
        Most of us grow up believing that conflict is a negative experience best 
        avoided. However, research has shown that conflict is not only unavoidable 
        but vital to growth. We first experience mismatches as infants, and how we 
        learn to handle those mismatches from our parents, teachers, peers and other 
        models informs how we try to resolve discord. This lecture will explore some 
        of that research based on The Power of Discord by Dr. Ed Tronick and Dr. Claudia 
        M. Gold, how it applies to everyday life and how we can rethink our own r
        elationships to build stronger ones.

    <h2>What is Mahloket?</h2>
    <p>
      Disagreements are often seen as an unfortunate aspect of life. However, in
      the tradition of the Mishnah and Talmud, mahkloket (debate) is a vital
      tool for fostering discussion, critical thinking, personal growth, and the
      strengthening of relationships.
      The Mahloket Matters initiative aims to highlight the Jewish value of
      constructive debate. Jewish tradition venerates the notion of productive
      disagreement and recognizes the potential for personal growth and deeper
      interpersonal connections through engagement with multiple perspectives.
      This program encourages participants to develop a “constructive conflict
      mindset” through Jewish text study, social psychology, and
      social-emotional learning. Ultimately, this mindset is not just for
      specific issues but serves as a lens to view and engage with the world in
      a more thoughtful and respectful manner.

    <h2>Why Mahloket Matters</h2>
    <h3>Excerpt for Karen’s article in the Dor Hadash newsletter</h3>
    <p>
      This past summer, I had the incredible opportunity to study in Jerusalem
      at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies, thanks to the support of
      Congregation Dor Hadash. Currently, I am a member of Cohort 4 of the
      Senior Educator Learning Fellowship (SELF). Despite the challenges of
      traveling during a time of conflict, the gratitude we received from the
      people there made it deeply meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being part of the SELF cohort was both a personal and professional
      milestone for me. The experience in Israel was profound, and I look
      forward to continuing the fellowship with monthly workshops on Zoom,
      culminating in an in-person gathering in May to conclude our program.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of my role in the SELF fellowship, I have begun to implement the
      Mahloket Matters curriculum within our community. I have presented to our
      teachers, at the Pittsburgh Yom Limud (a learning day for part-time
      religious school teachers), and to my colleagues at PAJE (Pittsburgh Area
      Jewish Educators).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mahloket Matters mindset employs Jewish texts and social psychology to
      foster meaningful discussion, critical thinking, personal growth, and
      deeper relationships.
